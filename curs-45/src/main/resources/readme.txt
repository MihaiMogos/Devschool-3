1. Creational design patterns
    - Factory (building an object of a given type, with small number of possible types)
    - Abstract factory (factory of factories)
    - Singleton (unique instance of a class)
    - Builder (more customizable created objects comparing to Factory)
    - Prototype (creating duplicate object while keeping performance in mind, when creating an object is very costly)
2. Behavioral design patterns
    - Chain of responsability
    - Command
    - Iterator
    - Observer
    - Strategy
    - Template
3. Structural design patterns
    - Decorator (adds extra functionality to existing implementation, after calling that legacy one)
    - Facade (hides the system's complexity when presenting to the client)
    - Proxy
